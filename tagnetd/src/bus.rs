//! The daemon ingest bus.
//!
//! Historically the runtime had a single `mpsc` channel carrying
//! `(Change, ChangeOrigin)` from every producer (the UI-facing [`Api`], the
//! sync-directory watcher, and inbound peer sessions) to the single
//! `handle_changes` task that is the sole DB writer.
//!
//! [`DaemonMessage`] widens that one channel into an enum so the *same* ordered
//! FIFO can also carry a request-reply message ([`DaemonMessage::Fetch`]) used
//! by `tagnet edit` to pull a file's bytes from a peer on demand. Keeping it
//! on the existing channel (rather than a second channel + `select!`) preserves
//! the order of a producer's messages relative to each other — e.g. an edit
//! enqueued just before a fetch of the same file — and reuses the existing
//! clone/drain/shutdown wiring.
//!
//! The reply travels back out-of-band via the `oneshot` carried in the `Fetch`
//! variant, mirroring the `SyncDirectoryCommand::ReadFile { respond_to }` idiom.
//! This is what lets the control layer stay decoupled from the peer/sync
//! machinery: it only ever holds an [`Api`](crate::api::Api), which enqueues a
//! `Fetch` and awaits the `oneshot`; the recursive fetch engine that talks to
//! peers lives entirely in `handle_changes`/the peer sessions.

/// device's sync directories. [`Ingest`] captures that split between a
/// content-bearing *local* ingestion and a metadata-only change:
///
/// - [`Ingest::Content`] — a local ingestion whose bytes are a [`FileBytes`]
///   (possibly still a path on disk). Produced only by local sources (the UI
///   API and the directory manager). `handle_changes` materializes the bytes
///   into matching sync directories and announces a metadata-only
///   `FileMetadataAdded`/`FileMetadataChanged` to peers.
/// - [`Ingest::Meta`] — any change that carries no local bytes, held as the
///   wire [`Change`]. This includes every inbound peer change: a peer's
///   `FileMetadataAdded`/`FileMetadataChanged` is a metadata announcement, and
///   this device pulls the bytes over a transfer if it wants them.
