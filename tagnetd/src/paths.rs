//! Central place for resolving on-disk locations under the tagnet data
//! directory. Keeping this in one struct avoids re-building paths by hand in
//! every call site.
//!
//! Historically these were free functions that read `TAGNET_DATA_DIR` /
//! `TAGNET_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` from the environment and `expect()`ed them. That
//! is fine for a shell-launched daemon but wrong for other frontends (e.g.
//! Android, where there is no shell environment and a panic crashes the app).
//!
//! The environment is therefore no longer consulted here. Each frontend
//! constructs a [`Paths`] value explicitly:
//!
//! - the desktop binary reads the environment (see `main.rs`),
//! - Android would pass `getFilesDir()` through the bridge.
