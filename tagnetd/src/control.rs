//! Daemon local control endpoint (portability plan section 7).
//!
//! On Linux the sync engine and the DB live in a long-running (systemd) daemon,
//! while the UI is a *separate* process. Because [`FileDatabase`] is
//! single-owner, the UI cannot open the DB itself — it must ask the daemon.
//! This module is that channel.
//!
//! ## Transport
//!
//! A **Unix-domain-socket** control listener at
//! [`paths::control_socket_path`](crate::paths::control_socket_path) (the fixed
//! `/run/tagnet/tagnet.sock`) — **not** a TCP port. Security is entirely
//! filesystem permissions: the runtime directory `/run/tagnet` is created
//! `0700` and owned by the service user (via `RuntimeDirectory=tagnet` in the
//! systemd unit), so only that user can connect and nothing is exposed on any
//! network interface. There is therefore **no auth handshake** for local
//! control (unlike the ed25519 peer handshake on the peer-sync port).
//!
//! The existing WebSocket/`Frame` framing (tokio + tokio-tungstenite) is reused
//! over the [`UnixListener`], so the networking code stays unified. The wire
//! payloads, however, are a **distinct message category** from the peer
//! `Change`/`Sync` protocol: peer framing is about *sync*; control framing
//! ([`ControlFrame`]) carries the section-5 API requests/responses/events.
//!
//! ## Relationship to the peer-sync port
//!
//! The `0.0.0.0:{listen_port}` listener is unchanged — it remains the remote
//! peer-sync port. UI control is **never** routed through it. A local UI client
//! is conceptually "another kind of client" of the daemon: it issues
//! queries/commands and subscribes to the change stream, reusing the same
//! broadcast plumbing (`event_sender` / [`Api::subscribe`]) that
//! `forward_to_peers` uses for peers.
//!
//! ## Two halves
//!
//! - [`serve_control`] is the **daemon side**: accepts connections, decodes
//!   [`ControlRequest`]s, dispatches them to the in-process [`Api`], and
//!   streams [`ApiEvent`]s back as [`ControlFrame::Event`].
//! - [`IpcClientBackend`] is the **client side** (portability plan section 6's
//!   IPC-client backend): it connects to the socket, serialises API calls, and
//!   returns results/events. It implements [`TransportBackend`], so the Dart UI
//!   (via `flutter_rust_bridge`) and the `tagnet` CLI talk to it exactly as
//!   they would the in-process backend.
