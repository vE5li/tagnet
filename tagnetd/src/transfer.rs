//! Pull-based file transfer over a single peer link.
//!
//! Bytes move by a *pull* protocol (see the `Sync::Transfer*` wire messages):
//! the **receiver** drives, the **sender** only replies. This yields fair
//! interleaving with other link traffic (the sender never emits a chunk
//! unprompted) and inherent backpressure (the receiver asks for the next chunk
//! only when it is ready), at the cost of a round-trip per chunk — which a
//! small in-flight *window* (see [`WINDOW`]) hides.
//!
//! This module provides the two **two-party** endpoints as self-contained async
//! drivers:
//!
//! - [`run_receiver`] — drives a transfer to completion: opens it, keeps a
//!   window of chunk requests in flight, streams replies to a temp file with
//!   incremental BLAKE3, verifies the hash on the final chunk, and returns the
//!   temp file as a [`FileBytes::FileToMove`] for the caller to materialize.
//! - [`run_sender`] — answers chunk requests for a [`FileBytes`] source by
//!   reading a bounded window at the requested offset.
//!
//! Each endpoint communicates over two channels so it can be driven by a peer
//! session (which demuxes inbound `Sync::Transfer*` frames by `TransferId`) or,
//! in tests, by wiring two endpoints back to back. The relayed (multi-hop)
//! fetch case is *not* here: it is a thin forwarding layer built on top of this
//! primitive (see `fetch`).
