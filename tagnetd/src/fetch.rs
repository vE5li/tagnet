//! On-demand recursive file fetch across the live peer tree.
//!
//! Used by `tagnet edit <uuid>` when a file's bytes are not present
//! locally. A [`Sync::FetchRequest`](tagnet_core::state::Sync::FetchRequest) is
//! flooded across the tree of *live* peer connections, which is assumed acyclic
//! (there is no seen-set / TTL — a node simply never forwards a request back to
//! the peer it arrived from). Modelled as a "call stack across machines":
//!
//! - Each node, on receiving a `FetchRequest` it cannot satisfy locally,
//!   forwards it to all its neighbours **except the one it came from** and
//!   records a [`PendingFetch`] so it knows where to return the answer.
//! - The **first** `FetchFound` whose hash matches wins and unwinds back toward
//!   the origin immediately; the pending entry is removed and any later replies
//!   for the same `request_id` are dropped.
//! - A node returns `FetchMissing` to its parent only once **every** child it
//!   forwarded to has returned `FetchMissing` or timed out.
//!
//! Every hop arms its own timeout so a single dead branch cannot stall the
//! chain; the originating CLI also applies an overall deadline.
//!
//! The pending table is shared (`Arc<Mutex<..>>`) between `handle_changes`
//! (which seeds *local-origin* requests coming off the ingest bus) and the peer
//! session tasks (which seed *relayed* requests and deliver replies). This is
//! the only cross-session coordination the feature introduces; the control
//! layer never touches it — it only enqueues a `DaemonMessage::Fetch` and
//! awaits the `oneshot`.
