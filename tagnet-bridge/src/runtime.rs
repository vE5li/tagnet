//! Native runtime lifecycle for embedded frontends (portability plan
//! section 8).
//!
//! On Android there is no `main()` and no `#[tokio::main]`: the app loads this
//! native library and calls in. The OS also freezes background threads under
//! Doze unless a foreground service keeps the process alive, so the tokio
//! runtime that drives sync must live on a thread this crate owns and starts
//! explicitly.
//!
//! [`RuntimeHandle`] encapsulates that lifecycle:
//!
//! 1. [`RuntimeHandle::start`] builds a multi-thread tokio runtime **manually**
//!    on a dedicated OS thread (never `#[tokio::main]`), performs the fallible
//!    startup ([`tagnetd::run`]) on that runtime, and returns once the
//!    UI-facing [`Backend`] is ready.
//! 2. The runtime thread then drives the sync engine to completion.
//! 3. [`RuntimeHandle::stop`] triggers the section-3 [`ShutdownSignal`] and
//!    joins the thread, so the service `onDestroy` tears everything down
//!    cleanly.
