//! Process-global runtime ownership (portability plan section 8).
//!
//! On Android the sync engine must keep running after the UI is closed. The
//! Flutter activity (and its Dart isolate) is destroyed when the app is swiped
//! away, but a **foreground service** in the same process keeps the process
//! alive. So the runtime cannot be owned by the Dart-side [`TagnetApp`]; it is
//! owned here, in a **process-global**, started by the foreground service
//! (over JNI, see [`crate::jni`]) and merely *attached to* by the UI when it
//! is open.
//!
//! There is exactly one runtime per process. `start` is idempotent: whoever
//! gets there first (normally the service) wins; later callers (the UI, or a
//! service restart) attach to the already-running instance. This preserves the
//! core's single-writer model — one `RuntimeHandle`, one DB writer — while
//! both the service and the UI reach it.
